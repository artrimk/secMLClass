# secMLClass
Secure Machine Learning Classification - The source code of a unified framework for secure Machine Learning (ML) classifications over encrypted data for ML classifiers that can be expressed in terms of matrix and linear algebra operations such as Naive Bayes (NB), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Based on where the bulk of operations are done, for all of those classifiers we provide both the server and the client/user centric scenarious.
For benchmark/comparison purposes with the related privacy-preserving state of the art schemes, we use 3 datasets:
1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin (original) dataset, which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)
2. The ADFA-NB15 cyber-security dataset, which can be found at https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/
3. The enron e-mail dataset, generated by - Metsis, Vangelis, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Georgios Paliouras. "Spam filtering with naive bayes-which naive bayes?." CEAS. Vol. 17. 2006.

Open the solution using Visual Studio 2017. Set the SEALExamples as the start-up project. The implementation uses Microsoft's SEAL library v3.2 found in https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL
